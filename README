readme

I create this git repository to have an easy-to-reach
 online space to store programming projects of my
students at http://www.spielend-programmieren.at

Experience shows that my homepage where i use to store
the student projects get reorganised and change of URL's 
far too often over the years.

most of the examples are in German language
